# Cen -- DNS over SMS
I have been thinking a lot about the idea of rendezvous. In a lot of censored countries around the world like France, ISPs do not resolve certain host names because they are legally forced not to.

I made this just for fun and also as a start in my journey of creating different out of band rendezvous schemes for different protocols. This could potentially be a way for someone in a censored region to text a phone number and get back a list of IP addresses they can connect to.

There are other methods that are more practical such as Domain Fronting, but I wanted to try out something totally new.
